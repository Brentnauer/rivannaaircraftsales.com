            <p>Rick Holtzman was correct when he sang the praises of the ease of working with you and Rivanna Aircraft Sales. I really appreciate your expertise in navigating the sale process from start to finish over the last three weeks. It has been a while (21 years!) since I was in the market for any aircraft. Your knowledge of the values and expected sale price were spot on and I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;re the reason the sale happened so quickly. The transfer process and escrow services were top notch as well. Their quick reaction to the buyer&#x27;s initial delay, then acceleration of the sale was taken in stride and did not delay the transfer. The fact that all of this happened smoothly, despite the limitations of the COVID-19 outbreak, just shows that Rivanna Aircraft Sales runs a well oiled machine. Thanks again for making this a smooth transition!</p>

            <p>In July we purchased an airplane from Rivanna Aircraft Sales. The whole process from the first phone call to the last hand shake at delivery was easy and enjoyable. John was very happy to answer or find answers to all questions and more than accommodating for last minute schedule changes on my end. It was nice getting to the aircraft and have it be just as it was described in the advertisement with no surprises. We are extremely happy and satisfied. Thanks again John.</p>

            <p>The experience of purchasing our Cessna 182, N8479S, from Rivanna Aircraft Sales was fun and a fair deal. John Decker was patient, helpful, and knowledgeable. The aircraft was represented well in the market literature and there were no surprises as my mechanic and I reviewed the logs. John is squared away, solid, and completely open. I enjoyed his easy, no pressure process and heartily recommend him to anyone looking to buy or sell an airplane.</p>

            <p>John recently brokered the sale my 1969 Cessna 150, and I would highly recommend his services to anyone considering selling a plane. After contacting several potential aircraft brokers in the region, I determined that Rivanna would be the best choice. And I&#x27;m confident that I made the right decision. John&#x27;s experience -- as a pilot, mechanic, and aircraft owner -- and his calm and friendly demeanor set him apart from others in the aviation business. He comes across as both knowledgeable and honest-- which is the type of person you want to be dealing with potential buyers. I was a first-time seller, and John made the process smooth and stress-free from start to finish.</p>

            <p>I purchased my 1969 C-172K utilizing the services of John Decker at Rivanna Aircraft Sales. I had been searching for a plane for about 2 years and after talking with John on the phone, decided I would work with no one else. John brokered the entire transaction with the utmost integrity and honesty, and was a pleasure to get to know in person. His aviation experience and wonderful personality made the process smooth from start to finish, even for someone as &quot;green&quot; as myself (purchasing an aircraft). He even handled a flight cancellation a day before closing with ease. He flew down to NC, picked me up, and we had a wonderful flight back to MD so I could close the deal. The services of John Decker were truly phenomenal and I will definitely be using him again when it&#x27;s time to trade up.</p>

His base knowledge of the used aircraft market and his mechanic certification and detailed logbook knowledge proved invaluable. In fact, I am absolutely certain that he was singularly responsible for brining the deal to a suitable close for both parties. He handled the transaction from initial advertising, through a complex annual and buyer&#x27;s inspection and eventually proved to be the asset that was responsible for completion of the sale.<br>I would be happy to discuss my experience with Mr. Decker with any potential client seeking his service.</p>

            <p>I have really been enjoying the plane. I also just wanted to say that as I was searching for a specific plane, I was apprehensive in making a deal so far from my home base. As I dealt and talked with John Decker at Rivanna Aircraft Sales, I became more at ease in a long distance deal. John brokered the purchase with the utmost integrity and was a pleasure to meet in person. He even handled a glitch that arose before takeoff, much to my surprise! What a standup guy! I have told everyone about his business, and can only hope there is a way to help him out in the future. If you need a plane, this is the person to go to!</p>

            <p>Every transaction is about trust. And that is exactly what brought me to you. In this buyers&#x27; market, where offers exceed the demand for aircraft, it is easy to get lost before so many advertised &quot;good deals&quot;. I was lucky to find you in this jungle. You have been professional and forthcoming from the beginning. Every request for information that I had, was responded by you immediately via email with supporting documentation in good photographic quality. This way of doing business had saved us a considerable amount of time in the process. Most important is the fact of been able to trust the person on the other side when receiving prompt and honest responses to every concern. This aircraft is for family enjoyment. I would have never allowed my love ones to fly on it unless I had an absolute certainty of the broker&#x27;s transparency. Above all, it was your integrity what brought me to you. I commend you, and I respect you for that.</p>

As the aircraft had been in our family for 42 years, this was not a joyous occasion, but it was necessary, and John Decker, Rivanna Aircraft Sales made the process as painless as could be reasonably be expected. He skillfully marketed the aircraft, negotiated a reasonable price in a time of deep economic recession, and patiently shepherded us through the complexities of the process. Indeed, we contributed little other than the aircraft, as John executed all the (to us) intimidating paperwork.
